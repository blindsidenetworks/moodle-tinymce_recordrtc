tinymce_recordrtc
=================

This plugin will add a button to the TinyMCE text editor in Moodle that facilitates
*audio/video* functionality and performs a near instant recording. Users are able to
validate the recorded *audio/video* and attach it to the html document through the
editor by embedding the recorded file in the current text area.
